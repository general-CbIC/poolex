Poolex is a library for managing pools of workers. Inspired by [poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy).

## Features

With `poolex` you can:

- Launch multiple pools of workers and then access the free ones from anywhere in the application.
- Configure the pool to run additional temporary workers if the load increases.
- Use your own implementations to define workers and callers access logic.

<details>
  <summary>Why `poolex` instead of `poolboy`?</summary>
  
- `poolex` is written in Elixir. This library is much more convenient to use in Elixir projects.
- `poolboy` is a great library, but not actively maintained at the moment :crying_cat_face: ![Last poolboy commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/devinus/poolboy?style=flat)

## Installation

Add `:poolex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:poolex, "~> 0.4.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

In the most typical use of Poolex, you only need to start pool of workers as a child of your application.

```elixir
children = [
  Poolex.child_spec(
    pool_id: :worker_pool,
    worker_module: SomeWorker,
    workers_count: 5
  )
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

Then you can execute any code on the workers with `run/3`:

```elixir
iex> Poolex.run(:worker_pool, &(is_pid?(&1)), timeout: 1_000)
{:ok, true}
```

A detailed description of the available configuration or examples of use can be found in [documentation](docs/guides.md).
