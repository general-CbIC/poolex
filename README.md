## Installation

Add `:poolex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:poolex, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

In the most typical use of Poolex, you only need to start pool of workers as a child of your application.

```elixir
pool_config = [
  worker_module: SomeWorker,
  workers_count: 5
]

children = [
  %{
    id: :worker_pool,
    start: {Poolex, :start_link, [:worker_pool, pool_config]}
  }
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

Then you can execute any code on the workers with `run/3`:

```elixir
iex> Poolex.run(:worker_pool, &(is_pid?(&1)), timeout: 1_000)
{:ok, true}
```

A detailed description of the available configuration or examples of use can be found in [documentation](docs/guides/).
